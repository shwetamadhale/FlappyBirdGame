## Background
This project is a simple browser-based game inspired by Flappy Bird. The player controls a bird that moves through obstacles while avoiding collisions with pipes and the ground.

## Install
To set up the project, clone the repository and open `game.html` in a web browser.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird.git
$ cd flappy-bird
$ open game.html
```

## Usage
1. Open `game.html` in a browser.
2. Press any key to make the bird flap.
3. Avoid obstacles to keep the game going.
4. The game restarts when the bird collides with an obstacle.

## Features
- **Bird Movement**: The bird moves upward when a key is pressed and falls due to gravity.
- **Obstacle Generation**: Pipes appear dynamically with random gaps.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects when the bird hits an obstacle or the ground.
- **Score Keeping**: The score increases each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styles the game elements.
- **JavaScript**: Implements game logic and event handling.

## Implementation Steps
1. **HTML Setup**:
   - Create a `canvas` element in `game.html`.
2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Design the background and game interface in `style.css`.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Implement bird movement, gravity, and collision detection in `game.js`.
4. **Event Handling**:
   - Add event listeners for user interaction.

## Future Enhancements
- **Improved Collision Detection**: Enhance accuracy of bird-pipe collision checks.
- **Game Over Screen**: Display a message when the game ends.
- **High Score Tracking**: Store and display the highest score achieved.
